Why Do We Need Generators?
Memory Efficient : Handle large or infinite data without loading everything into memory.
No List Overhead : Yield items one by one, avoiding full list creation.
Lazy Evaluation : Compute values only when needed, improving performance.
Support Infinite Sequences : Ideal for generating unbounded data like Fibonacci series.
Pipeline Processing : Chain generators to process data in stages efficiently.
